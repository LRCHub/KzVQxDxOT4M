We like to party
Sleep around with secrets,
grab somebody
But don't go tell your mama
'cause she won't sleep
She won't sleep, no,
she won't sleep, sleep
Oh oh oh oh
We like to party
Sleep around with secrets,

But don't go tell your mama
'cause she won't sleep
She won't sleep, no,
she won't sleep, sleep
Oh oh oh oh
They say you're never too young
for a party
They say you're never too young,
come and play
No-one cares if you're nice or
you're naughty
You'll still get presents on
Christmas Day
You know you're never too old
for the kingdom
'Cause the kingdom's
in your veins
I'm not a queen, but you know
that I'm the kingpin
If you're a freak then come
and play
(If you're a freak then come
and play)

Oh oh oh oh
Party

Oh oh oh oh
They say you're never too tired
for the weekend
'Cause the weekend's
all we crave
No-one knows who we are
when we pretend
'Cause all our secrets sound
the same
And when you're all messed up
from the comedown
Swear you'll never go back there
again
You hear a voice in your head
as you lay down
If you're a freak then come
and play
(If you're a freak then come
and play)

Don't go tell your mother
'cause she won't sleep
(Sleep, won't sleep)
Don't go tell your mother
'cause she won't sleep
