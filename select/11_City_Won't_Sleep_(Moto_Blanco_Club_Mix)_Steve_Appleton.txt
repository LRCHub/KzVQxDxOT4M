Across boarder this city wont sleep tonight
Over the water, touch down in the city lights
Looks like we are a million miles away
From any place I've gone, from any face I known

I'm alive, I'm alive, yeah
I don't wanna be any other place i want
I wanna take this night any other way

So come on, come on
I have been rocking all over the world
This city won't sleep tonight

Feels like Vegas but I'm just traveling man
So take a breath in my atmosphere
'Cause me and this city
Are on a one night stand tonight, yeah

Went by so slowly
Better luck than a champagne moment
One night only, I leave it all behind
So I can feel free, yeah, feeling free

I don't wanna be any other place I want
I wanna take this night any other way

So come on, come on
I have been rocking all over the world
This city won't sleep tonight

So come on, come on
Look where my heart is
Leaving this city will be one the hardest

Come on, come on
Look where my heart is
Leaving this city will be one the hardest

Come on, come on
Look where my heart is
Leaving this city will be one the hardest

Come on, come
Look where my heart is
'Cause this city won't sleep tonight

I don't wanna be any other place I want
I wanna take this night any other way

So come on, come on
I have been rocking all over the world
This city won't sleep tonight

I don't wanna be any other place I want
I wanna take this night any other way

So come on, come on
I have been rocking all over the world
This city won't sleep tonight

Won't sleep tonight
Won't sleep tonight
Tonight
