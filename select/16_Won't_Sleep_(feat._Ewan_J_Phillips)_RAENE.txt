I was so high I didn't see the sun
So you were looking like a red light
Well I was too shy
I would let you get away with it every time

I never meant to be the wrong thing for you
I never meant to be the one thing you can't lose
But admitting it all
You were my hammer to fall

If we'd have known that it was the last time
Would you have stayed the night?
Would you have held me tight?
Throw me a laugh and say you wanna try?
That it'll be alright?
So we can sleep tonight?

Though we know we won't
Sleep
Sleep tonight
Though we know we won't
Be
Be alright

I'm so tired of needin' closure
So tired of stayin' over
Just to say goodnight
And lay by your side
Knowing it's not right

Well, I was so blind
Never trusted doubt when it crossed my mind
Well, I was so dumb
Had me thinkin', thinkin' you could be the one

I never meant to be the wrong thing for you
I never meant to be the one thing you can't lose
But admitting it all
You were my hammer to fall

If we'd have known that it was the last time
Would you have stayed the night?
Would you have held me tight?
Throw me a laugh and say you wanna try?
That it'll be alright?
So we can sleep tonight?

Though we know we won't
Sleep
Sleep tonight
Though we know we won't
Be
Be alright

I'm so tired of needin' closure
So tired of stayin' over
Just to say goodnight
And lay by your side
Knowing it's not right

Now you're gone, it don't feel any different
'Cause you were never even here when you were with me
Now you're gone, it don't feel any different
'Cause you were never even here when you were with me
Now you're gone, it don't feel any different
'Cause you were never even here when you were with me
Now you're gone, it don't feel any different
'Cause you were never even here

If we'd have known that it was the last time
Would you have stayed the night?
Would you have held me tight?
Throw me a laugh and say you wanna try?
That it'll be alright?
So we can sleep tonight?

Though we know we won't
Sleep
Sleep tonight
Though we know we won't
Be
Be alright

I'm so tired of needin' closure
So tired of stayin' over
Just to say goodnight
And lay by your side
Knowing it's not right
