The pain lingers
Your scream breaks through
The silence of the night
And reach deep in my heart

I've committed a crime
The remorse is mine
Imprisoned in the moon
I know I won't see you soon

Just tell me what have I done?
I don't want to be on my own
And this sadness won't let me breathe
Please let it end

I won't sleep tonight
I won't cry tonight
Because of all this pain inside me
Should I go and try to fight this?

I won't sleep tonight
I will cry tonight
Because my heart is full of sadness
Can you help me fight this nightmare?

Don't you see?
Don't you feel heartbroken?
You left me behind suffering

These memories remain
That's the weight of your mistakes
They can not be erased

I want to see you once again
I will fight until the end
Saving you on me depends

I won't fear tonight
I will fight tonight
Against all my inner demons
No more doubts, I will defeat them

Now my mind is clear
I will set you free
I knew this curse wouldn't last forever
Finally we'll be together

Set me free
From this spell
Take me there
I want to see you once again

Set me free

I won't sleep tonight
I won't cry tonight

Sister, it's alright
I will save you now
From all the pain that you have suffered
No more tears, I've got you covered

Welcome home princess
Wait for the sunset
To raise the moon like you did always
Guard our dreams while you are out there

To raise the moon like you did always
Guard our dreams while you are out there

To raise the moon like you did always
