[01:50.08] Stay down, special
[01:54.95] The day breaks
[01:58.33] Save us, timber
[02:01.93] Worn out on time
[02:09.93] 
[02:04.99] Makes sense sometimes
[02:08.77] Too late, fly
[02:12.05] Drawn out, point at
[02:15.47] Someone out there
[02:23.97] 
[04:23.55] Walk out so strong, in spite of time
[04:29.44] We wont sleep now, they wont make a sound
[04:35.81] The chances lost, the time is won
[04:41.77] In all we trust, to keep from harm.
