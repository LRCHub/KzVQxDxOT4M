Sleep won't sleep, her eyes won't fall
Desire's gonna carry me down to the shore

All night on the other side
I'll be with you on the other side

Cause dead they dance their songs can sing
And purple flowers grow where they've been

All night on the other side
I'll be with you on the other side

Endlessly come and dance with me
In the dark I see, a vision of you

I'm going down where they play all night
Where the ghosts show the living how their shadows are so bright

All night on the other side
I'll be with you on the other side

Recklessly come and dance with me
In the dark I see, a moment of you, only you

Endlessly come and dance with me
In the dark I see, a moment of you, only you

Waves keep crashing on the Malacon
The son keeps playing and we're rolling on and ...

All night on the other side
I'll be with you on the other side

Sleep won't sleep, her eyes won't fall
Desire's gonna carry me down to the shore

All night on the other side
I'll be with you on the other side
