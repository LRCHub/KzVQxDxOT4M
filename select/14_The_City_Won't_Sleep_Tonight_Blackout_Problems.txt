Step outside where,
Dull scissors could cut the air,
Something's wrong here,
The people's voices in despair,
The papers write about us, TV talks about us,
But the fact is they never listen to us
On his golden chair,
The king is scared,
The empire falls,
We've been safely prepared.
You've build it brick by brick  you'll see me spit on it  you should
hope to get out alive
The city won't sleep tonight (not tonight)
We riot all over town, all over town tonight.
Brother take care,
The biggest cross is the hardest to bear,
I have been there,
I know this fight is far from fair,
I've seen the envy, the greed,
Seen the blood on the street,
Seen the madness,
Of the kings & the queens,
The chair was spotted,
At lost & found,
We shook the earth,
& we stood our ground.
We paint the sky blue,
We paint the streets red,
We paint the sky blue,
Fight us, we fight back.
