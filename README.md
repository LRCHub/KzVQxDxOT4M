[00:58.54] 'Cause the kingdom's in your vein
[01:02.16] I'm not a queen, but you know that I'm the kingpin

[01:54.02] 'Cause all our secrets sound the same
[02:12.52] 
[01:57.59] And when you're all messed up from the comedown
[02:01.03] Swear you'll never go back there again
[02:04.22] You hear a voice in your head as you lay down
[02:07.97] If you're a freak, then come and play
